# AWS Certification Study Guide

### Current Unavailable: https://www.aws-certifications.com/

-   Internal tool to create quizzes to study for AWS certifications. Not satisfied with available online study materials for this certification, I decided to create this website to allow me to study and gain knowledge at a rapid pace. Questions are dynamic with randomization and different formats which prevent strict memorization.

Additional quizzes and study materials will be added in the future.
